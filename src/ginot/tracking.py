"""Planner tracking model: per-plan review state, stored in data/plan_status.json.

States: new (default on first appearance), reviewed, objection_filed,
no_objection_needed, urgent. All state changes are human-made (the planner's),
except: missing plans default to 'new', and an *advisory* urgent flag is
computed when a plan in an undecided state (new/reviewed) has a derived
objection deadline within URGENT_WITHIN_DAYS. Nothing is ever auto-filed;
this model is bookkeeping for a human reviewer only. Its states and notes are NEVER written to public artifacts (refresh.py strips them; only the machine-derived advisory urgency flag is published).
